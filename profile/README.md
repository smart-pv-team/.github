### SmartPV
The project was developed as a part of a bachelor thesis as well as on behalf of a client.
The idea of software is to transform produced by PV farm energy in real time, avoiding expensive storage costs.

### Results

Final product version was successfully delivered on 01.01.2023. Beta version was in use since 01.07.2022 and in 4 months period
was able to **save 10MWh of energy during 4 months period**.

All measurements and summaries are presented in [documentation](docs.pdf)

The project was handed over to the client and is no longer supported by us.
